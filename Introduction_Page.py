    This web application is a collection of simple demos of 
    Linear Regression. I have implemented both the frequentist
    and Bayesian approaches to Linear Regression.
    
    ### Simple Linear Regression
    - Regress a response variable on a single predictor variable.
    - See the model's predictions, credible interval, and prediction interval.
    - Take a look at which coefficients are significant and see the model's summary statistics.
    - Change the basis functions to see how the model changes.
    - Supported basis functions: Polynomial, Gaussian, Sigmoid, Sinusoidal.
    
    ### Bayesian Linear Regression Manual Input
    - Manually place data points on the graph and see how the model changes.
    - See the posterior distribution of the model's parameters.
    
    ### Bayesian Linear Regression Automatic
    - Automatically generate data points from a given function.
    - See the posterior distribution of the model's parameters.
